This will be a website concept to aid anyone forgetting anything. It will be powered by submissions.

Meteor will be my tentative framework of choice for this endeavor.

Known Tasks
-----------
* See if an "else" case can be applied to the admin view, when no flagged memories exist.
* Store messages and possibly errors in database.
* Secure admin view, either by implementing and just having one (admin), or somehow restricting it to certain IPs.
* Allow users to view memories in a random order, rather than by upvotes.
* Deploy app (need secure admin view before this) and add some additional starter memories.
* Make copyright suck less.
