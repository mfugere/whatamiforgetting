This will be a website concept to aid anyone forgetting anything. It will be powered by submissions.

Meteor will be my tentative framework of choice for this endeavor.

Known Tasks
-----------
* Add "success" messaging, and possibly abstract away from Meteor.Error for Session storage of all messages.
* Secure admin view, either by implementing and just having one (admin), or somehow restricting it to certain IPs.
* Deploy app (need secure admin view before this) and add some additional starter memories.
* Make copyright suck less.
